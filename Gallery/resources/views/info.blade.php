        HISTORY
        </h1>

        <div>
        In 2017, after almost a decade of informal association, professional and amateur artist of Cyprus active in
            Limassol area began the process of forming an independent organization, to provide more opportunities
            to the members and better service to the local community. This move was a result of personal initiative
            of the artist and businessperson from Cyprus Mrs. Anna Roman who’s energy and ideas gave a launch to the Association of Mediterranean Artists
        </div>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../storage/images/strange_woman.jpg">

        <div>
        Soon after decision to register Association of Mediterranean Artists was made the ambitions of the initial
            members went far wider then Cyprus. Many artists from abroad joined Association of Mediterranean Artists to create multicultural creative environment.
        </div>

        <div>
        The Association of Mediterranean Artists was incorporated on October 5, 2017 as a nonprofit corporation
            dedicated to promoting fine arts through open juried international exhibitions, members' exhibitions
            , workshops, and periodical newsletters and meetings (except in summer when it’s too hot in Cyprus).
            Members of Association of Mediterranean Artists enjoy sharing knowledge, learning new painting techniques, and passing on published information.
        </div>

        <div>
         Membership has grown from a small nucleus of Limassol area artists, to a membership drawn from throughout
            the Mediterranean, Russia, Canada, and Mexico. All officers on the Board of Directors of AMA are strictly volunteer.
        </div>
        <div>

            good standing after he or she has had paintings accepted in ten [10] AMA International Exhibits. This
            then entitles them to affix the initials AMA after their name. Signature status shall be for as long as the member is in good standing.
    </div>
